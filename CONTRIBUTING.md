I'd be glad to craft a comprehensive contributing.md guide specifically tailored to the Node.js Express API projects:

**Welcome Contributors!**

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the Node.js Express API and React.js project. Your contributions help us enhance and maintain this valuable resource.

**Getting Started**

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Visit the project repository on GitHub.
   - Click the "Fork" button to create your own copy.

2. **Clone Your Fork:**
   - Open a terminal window.
   - Use `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/minor-project.git` to clone your forked repository locally.

3.1 **Install Dependencies for backend:**

- Navigate to backend  your cloned directory using `cd backend`.
- Run `npm install` to install the required Node.js packages.

3.2 **Install Dependencies for frontend:**

- Navigate to frontend  your cloned directory using `cd frontend`.
- Run `npm install` to install the required Node.js packages.

4. **Create a Branch:**
   - Use `git checkout -b <your-branch-name>` to create a new branch for your changes.
   - Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `backend/fix-route-handling`, `frontend/add-feature-x`).

5. ## Branch Naming Conventions for Contributors

Here's a common branch naming convention for contributors in Git projects:

- **Prefix:**
  - Use a prefix to indicate the type of change. Common prefixes include:
    - **feature/**: For new features.
    - **bugfix/**: For bug fixes.
    - **hotfix/**: For critical bug fixes that need to be deployed urgently.
    - **chore/**: For changes that improve the development workflow but don't directly add features (e.g., documentation updates, dependency updates).
    - **test/**: For adding or modifying tests.
- **Description:**
  - Briefly describe the change in a clear and concise way. Use kebab-case (lowercase words separated by hyphens).
- **Issue reference (optional):**
  - If the branch relates to a specific issue in a tracking system (e.g., GitHub Issues), include the issue number after a hyphen (`-`).

**Example:**

```
frontend/feature/add-search-functionality  // Adds a search function to the application
backend/bugfix/login-page-crash           // Fixes a crash on the login page
backend/hotfix/critical-database-error     // Urgent fix for a critical database error
backend/chore/update-dev-dependencies     // Updates development dependencies
frontend/test/improve-unit-test-coverage   // Improves unit test coverage
```

## Example for a Specific Issue

Let's say you're working on an issue reported on GitHub (#123) where users cannot upload profile pictures. Your branch name would follow the format:

```
bugfix/issue-123-cannot-upload-profile-picture
```

## Example Commit Message

A good commit message should be clear, concise, and informative. Here's a common format:

- **Verb in imperative mood:** Start the message with a verb in the imperative mood (e.g., fix, add, remove).
- **Brief description:** Briefly describe the change made.
- **Issue reference (optional):** Include a reference to the related issue number in brackets (e.g., [Fixes #123]).
- **Additional details (optional):** You can add additional details about the change if necessary.

**Example:**

```
fronted-fix: Fixed issue where users cannot upload profile pictures [Fixes #123]
```

By following these conventions, contributors can ensure clear and consistent branching and version control within a project.
**Development Guidelines**

- **Code Style:** Adhere to consistent coding style throughout the project. Consider using a linter or code formatter like ESLint or Prettier.
- **Testing:** Write unit tests for your changes using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
- **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation (README.md, API docs) to reflect new features or bug fixes.
- **Commit Messages:** Craft clear and concise commit messages that describe your changes. Utilize a format like "feat: Add feature X" or "fix: Resolve bug Y".
- **Type Safety (Optional):** If the project doesn't currently use TypeScript, consider incorporating it for improved type checking and maintainability.
